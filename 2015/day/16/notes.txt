Max nchar = 50 (so will ned input_line 52)

Data structure
int sues[N_SUES][N_PROPERTIES];
int possible_sues_i[]; // for index of sues still in contention (starts at 500)
int possible_sues_n; // the number of possible sues

Reading in and storing the data:
- Store the string in `line` then use strtok() to split the string, after the first ": then after "," 
- From each token (after the first) use sscanf() to save the property and value
- Have an array of property names and a function to get an index for the column of `sues`
- Have a function that takes a property name and value and updates `possible_sues_i` and `possible_sues_n` with the narrowed possibilities after each filtering.
