[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a series of increasingly difficult programming challenges, 
released daily each year throughout December in the run-up to Christmas.

This website is created from the [EllaKaye/advent-of-code](https://github.com/EllaKaye/advent-of-code) repository.
I use it to keep a record of my solutions and make notes about what I learn along the way. It is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and supported by [R functions](https://github.com/EllaKaye/advent-of-code/blob/main/R/setup.R) to ease the process of downloading the data and creating the posts.

The idea for this site came from seeing [Emil Hvitfeldt's version](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/rstats-adventofcode/).
The styling is based on my [personal site](https://ellakaye.co.uk).
